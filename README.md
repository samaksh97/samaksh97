About Me: 
As society grew to be more data-driven, I found myself to be interested in telling thought-provoking stories using data.  Previously, I have also worked as a Senior Product Analyst with the Ads Monetization team @ Meesho where I was responsible for improving Search results and Personalization and building an Ad Campaign Optimization framework to enable a real-time CPC (Cost per Click) bidding feature. I also revamped the existing experimentation setup by introducing Multi-Arms Bandit algorithms and real-time experimentation which directly resulted in a 3% increase in Ad-revenue. While working as a Data Scientist at a US Based Consulting Firm, ZS Associates, I built AI Customer Journey products and worked on a variety of business issue areas such as customer segmentation, deployment analytics to social media marketing to inform the go-to-market commercial strategy.
